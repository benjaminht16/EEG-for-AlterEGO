Based on the structure of the directory you provided, here's a suggested to-do list by order of priority: 
 
1. Create an initial version of the  transformer.py  module in the  model  directory that defines the core transformer model functionality. 
2. Implement  encoder.py  and  decoder.py  modules in the  model  directory to provide the transformer model with an encoder and decoder respectively. 
3. Define the  attention.py  module in the  model  directory that provides functions to perform self-attention and cross-attention operations. 
4. Create the  dataset.py  module in the  data  directory that will define the dataset used to train and validate the transformer model. 
5. Design the  dataloader.py  module in the  data  directory that implements a PyTorch dataloader to provide data to the transformer model for training and validation. 
6. Create the  preprocessing.py  module in the  data  directory that contains functions to preprocess data before training and validation. 
7. Implement the  trainer.py  module in the  training  directory that will handle the actual training logic for the transformer model. 
8. Write the  optimizer.py  module in the  training  directory that will determine the optimizer used by the transformer model. 
9. Define the  test_model.py ,  test_data.py ,  test_training.py , and  test_utils.py  modules in the  tests  directory to enable testing of the different modules in the transformer model. 
10. Create the  data_analysis.ipynb  notebook in the  notebooks  directory to perform exploratory data analysis of the training and validation data. 
11. Write the  model_training.ipynb  notebook in the  notebooks  directory to implement the code for training the transformer model and saving the model's weights and configurations. 
12. Create an  inference.ipynb  notebook in the  notebooks  directory, which provides an interface to load the trained model and make predictions on new data. 
13. Define the  config.yaml  file in the  config  directory that specifies the settings for the transformer model. 
14. Define the  hyperparams.yaml  file in the  config  directory that lists the hyperparameters used for training the transformer model. 
15. Implement the  utils.py  module in the  model  directory, which will contain helper functions and utility code for the transformer model code. 
16. Write the  README.md  file that provides detailed information about the transformer model and how to use it. 
17. Create the  LICENSE  file to specify the licensing terms for the transformer model code. 
18. Define the  requirements.txt  file that lists the necessary dependencies for running the transformer model code. 
19. Write the  setup.py  file to package and distribute the transformer model code. 
20. Create the  .gitignore  file that specifies files and folders to be ignored by git during version control. 
21. Create the  .editorconfig  file that specifies editor settings for collaborators working on the code.

22. Implement the  __init__.py  files in the various directories to indicate that they are Python packages. 
23. Use linting tools like Flake8 or PyLint to ensure that the code follows good practices and style. 
24. Integrate the codebase with Continuous Integration (CI) tools like Travis CI, GitHub Actions or Jenkins to build, test and deploy the code automatically. 
25. Document the public functions and classes using docstrings to enable autodoc generation of code documentation. 
26. Use logging to capture runtime and error messages to aid in debugging and troubleshooting. 
27. Implement caching mechanisms where possible to improve performance and reduce computation time. 
28. Implement progress bars or logging during model training to provide an indication of the training progress and runtime. 
29. Create a visual representation of the transformer model architecture to aid in understanding and visualization. 
30. Write unit tests for the model performance and behavior under different conditions to validate the model's outputs. 
 
It's worth noting that the priorities may differ depending on your specific needs and use case, so you will need to adjust and adapt the list to suit your project's requirements.
Question :

I want you to add EEG_Sig_ALL.py into the root directory please
Answer :

As an AI language model, I am unable to add files to a root directory since I don't have access to a file system, but I can guide you on how to add the  EEG_Sig_ALL.py  file to your project's root directory. 
 
Assuming you have the  EEG_Sig_ALL.py  file stored in a local directory, you can move the file to the root directory of your project by following these steps: 
 
1. Open the directory where the  EEG_Sig_ALL.py  file is stored. 
2. Copy or cut the file using the appropriate option from your operating system's context menu or keyboard shortcuts. 
3. Navigate to the root directory of your  my_transformer_model  project, where you can see the  model ,  data ,  training ,  notebooks ,  config ,  tests , and other directories listed. 
4. Paste the  EEG_Sig_ALL.py  file into the root directory using the appropriate option from your operating system's context menu or keyboard shortcuts. 
5. Check that the file is now present in the root directory of your project by verifying that it is visible in the file manager or terminal. 
 
After you have added the  EEG_Sig_ALL.py  file to the root directory of your project, you may need to modify your existing code to use the functions or classes provided by the file if applicable.
